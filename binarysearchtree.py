'''QUESTION 1: As a senior backend engineer at Jovian, you are tasked with developing a fast in-memory data structure to manage profile information (username, name and email) for 100 million users. It should allow the following operations to be performed efficiently:
	1. Insert the profile information for a new user.
	2. Find the profile information of a user, given their username
	3. Update the profile information of a user, given their username
	4. List all the users of the platform, sorted by username
You can assume that usernames are unique.'''
